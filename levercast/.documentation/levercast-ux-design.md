## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

### Color Philosophy
- **Base Themes**: 
  - Dark Mode (Primary): Deep space-inspired dark backgrounds (#121212, #1E1E1E) with high-contrast interactive elements
  - Light Mode (Alternative): Clean whites and soft grays (#FFFFFF, #F8F9FA) with subtle shadows for depth

### UI Component Styling
- **Card Elements**: Subtle elevation through minimal shadows in light mode, subtle highlight borders in dark mode
